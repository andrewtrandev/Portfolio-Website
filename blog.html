                <div class="blogtext">
                    today was alright, I guess I got through that online lecture and did the flex froggy thing. 
                    Didn't do as much study as I thought I would, that's okay I'll try harder tomorrow. Was pretty 
                    tired today. Played some league and watched some eps of castlevania with Will. Also 
                    need to figure out an at home workout, since gym is closed due to coronavirus. Pretty crazy how 
                    the government is starting to close non-essential services such as pubs, nightclubs, restaurants 
                    and cafes. Well they're allowing takeaway but yeah, who would've thought something like this would
                    happen in our lifetime. It's a scary time. You'd think with how the world and tehcnology has progressed so quickly 
                    and etc that we wouldn't run into problems like a disease that's severely crippling our economy and 
                    forcing people to restrict their freedom.

                    9:24pm -
                    Back to learning and feeling quite good about it. Was finding the whole thing pretty daunting and today required 
                    some strenuous thinking for the later problems. Don't know what to write for the blogposts, maybe just talk about 
                    my journey and feelings and that kind of stuff. Might be good to just get in the habit of running a blog.
                    I havn't really felt this optimistic about the future for awhile, I think before I was just coasting through life, 
                    if things happened I let them happen, if opportunities came, I took em, but I didn't go out of my way to do any of 
                    these things. I think starting this course was a step in the right direction. I having a feeling it's going to be 
                    one of the toughest things I'll do and I want to maintain that slightly anxious/exciting feeling of growth.

                <h2>Coder Academy - first day over</h2>
                <p>25/2/20</p>
                <div class="blogtext">
                    6:02am - Can't sleep, was lying in bed since 5am. Maybe need to start doing morning workouts. Seems like I'm pushed for time later in the day.
                    I've enjoyed my foray back to learning so far. It's exciting to be back in a student environment and surrounded by new people. The last 3 years have been steady for 
                    me but my growth had stagnated and I was growing tired and itching to do something different. Maybe I'm a bit too excited snd can't sleep, got about 5.5 hours in. 
                    It's weird but I think I'm on a right path, I don't think it's the only path but it's something that is going to challenge me to grow and push me to become more of myself.
                    Quite surprised that so many people enjoy anime/manga and books. 
                    Stories are so important, research stories later.
