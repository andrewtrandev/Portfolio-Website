        <h2>Ruby Terminal Application</h2>
        <p>I worked on a word game application to run in terminal using the Ruby language. 
            <br>
            Features:
            Replay game - a while loop that allows you to continue to play again by selecting either yes/no. <br><br>

            Limited it to just a menu select for yes/no so that user can't enter other commands and inputs are sanitized.<br><br>

            Accruing point system - points earned will carry over to future games in the instance. <br>
            Adds the score onto a variable outside the while loop so that the score doesn't get reset each time the game goes <br>
            through the while loop.<br><br>
            
            Vowel adder - if number of letters is greater than 6, add more vowels to make the game easier. <br>
            Done through a method that first checks if the word is less than 6 letters and if so will shuffle at least one vowel in, <br>
            if the word is greater than 6 letters it'll shuffle at least 2 vowels in. This is done through if/else and shuffling of arrays.<br><br>
            
            Mismatching letters loop - If user inputs letters that don't equal the output randomized letters then continue running a <br>
            while loop that outputs the random letters and prompts them to input letters that match the output randomized letters. <br>
            I was initially using delete() but that would delete every instance of a variable and cause errors for words like 'goon'. <br>
            Had to delete the specific letter in the array by referencing it's index using .index and also had to make a different array<br>
            so that it wasn't deleting the original arrays letters.<br><br>
            
            Scrabble hash - Calculates score using a scrabble hash which values rarer words higher versus the original idea of using <br>
            length of the word. Downloaded a 3rd party ruby file and used require_relative to access it's functionality.<br></p>
