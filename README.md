### Purpose
As an aspiring developer, I'm creating a website portfolio to test and apply knowledge of html and css in practice and also get a nifty portfolio out at the end of it. I'll be able to further develop and refine my skills by continually improving this website. 

I've modified the website to also be mobile friendly and be accessible to the visually impaired.
